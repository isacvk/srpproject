        The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems,
        liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may
        be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a
        cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to
        flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They
        can kill tissue and damage your organs. In some cases, lung transplants
        have been needed.If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself
        or a loved one, get medical help right away:
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Trouble breathing or shortness of breath<br />
        Ongoing chest pain or pressure<br />
        New confusion<br />
        Can’t wake up fully<br />
        Bluish lips or face<br />
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19.
        Remember FAST:<br />
        Face. Is one side of the person’s face numb or drooping? Is their smile
        lopsided?<br />
        Arms. Is one arm weak or numb? If they try to raise both arms, does one
        arm sag?<br />
        Speech. Can they speak clearly? Ask them to repeat a sentence.<br />
        Time. Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke. Call 911
        right away.<br />
        If you’re infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many
        as 14. It varies from person to person.According to researchers in
        China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had

        Some people who are hospitalized for COVID-19 have also have dangerous
        blood clots, including in their legs, lungs, and arteries.What to do if

        If you don’t feel well, stay home. Even if you have mild symptoms like a
        headache and runny nose, stay in until you’re better. This lets doctors
        focus on people who are more seriously ill and protects health care
        workers and people you might meet along the way. You might hear this
        called self-quarantine. Try to stay in a separate room away from other
        people in your home. Use a separate bathroom if you can.

      <p class="content-desc">
        Call the doctor if you have trouble breathing. You need to get medical
        help as soon as possible. Calling ahead (rather than showing up) will
        let the doctor direct you to the proper place, which may not be your
        doctor’s office. If you don’t have a regular doctor, call your local
        board of health. They can tell you where to go for testing and
        treatment.

        Follow your doctor’s advice and keep up with the news on COVID-19.
        Between your doctor and health care authorities, you’ll get the care you
        need and information on how to prevent the virus from spreading.
