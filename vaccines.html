      <h3 class="content-heading">COVID-19 vaccine</h3>
      <p class="content-desc">
        A COVID 19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity
        against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV 2),
        the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19). Prior to the
        COVID 19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the
        structure and function of coronaviruses causing diseases like severe
        acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome
        (MERS). This knowledge accelerated the development of various vaccine
        platforms during early 2020. The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines
        was on preventing symptomatic, often severe illness. On 10 January 2020,
        the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence data was shared through GISAID, and by
        19 March, the global pharmaceutical industry announced a major
        commitment to address COVID-19. The COVID 19 vaccines are widely
        credited for their role in reducing the spread, severity, and death
        caused by COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Many countries have implemented phased distribution plans that
        prioritize those at highest risk of complications, such as the elderly,
        and those at high risk of exposure and transmission, such as healthcare
        workers. Single dose interim use is under consideration to extend
        vaccination to as many people as possible until vaccine availability
        improves.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        As of 18 September 2021, 5.92 billion doses of COVID 19 vaccines have
        been administered worldwide based on official reports from national
        public health agencies. AstraZeneca anticipates producing 3 billion
        doses in 2021, Pfizer–BioNTech 1.3 billion doses, and Sputnik V,
        Sinopharm, Sinovac, and Janssen 1 billion doses each. Moderna targets
        producing 600 million doses and Convidecia 500 million doses in 2021. By
        December 2020, more than 10 billion vaccine doses had been preordered by
        countries, with about half of the doses purchased by high-income
        countries comprising 14% of the world's population.

      <h3 class="content-heading">COVID-19 hospitalization</h3>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Studies show that certain common medical conditions put people at higher
        risk for severe illness from COVID-19. These include metabolic disorders
        like type 2 diabetes and obesity, as well as heart conditions like high
        blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. People with these four
        conditions are more likely to be hospitalized with COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        To better understand how these conditions affect hospitalizations, a
        research team led by Meghan O’Hearn and Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian of Tufts
        University developed a statistical model. They incorporated data on the
        association of these four underlying conditions with COVID-19
        hospitalizations in the U.S. They also included national data on
        COVID-19 hospitalizations and prevalence of the conditions by age, sex,
        and race/ethnicity.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Based on this data, the model calculated the percentage of COVID-19
        hospitalizations that could have been prevented without these four
        underlying conditions. Results were published in the Journal of the
        American Heart Association on February 25, 2021.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        The researchers estimated that more than 900,000 COVID-19
        hospitalizations occurred through November 2020. Based on their model,
        30% of these hospitalizations were attributable to obesity, 26% to
        hypertension, 21% to diabetes, and 12% to heart failure. These people
        would still have been infected with COVID-19, but likely would not have
        been sick enough to need hospitalization.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        More than one of these conditions are often present in the same person.
        The model also estimated hospitalizations due to different combinations.
        The numbers weren’t simply additive. In total, 64% of the
        hospitalizations might have been prevented if not for the four
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        The model suggested that COVID-19 hospitalizations due to these
        conditions varied by age. Older adults with diabetes, heart failure, or
        hypertension were more likely to be hospitalized than younger people
        with the same condition. However, obesity affected COVID-19
        hospitalization risk similarly across age groups.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Race/ethnicity also resulted in disparities in COVID-19 hospitalizations
        due to these conditions. Black adults had the highest proportion of
        hospitalizations attributable to all four conditions at any age. Other
        studies show that COVID-19 deaths have disproportionately affected Black
        and other minority communities
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        This research further highlights the burden of heart and metabolic
        diseases in the U.S. Almost 3 in 4 U.S. adults is overweight or obese.
        Nearly half of people have prediabetes or diabetes.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        All of the conditions examined in the study have been shown to impair
        the body’s immune response. This may be one reason COVID-19 causes more
        harm in people with these underlying conditions. Improving heart and
        metabolic health may help reduce hospitalizations from COVID-19.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        “Medical providers should educate patients who may be at risk for severe
        COVID-19 and consider promoting preventive lifestyle measures, such as
        improved dietary quality and physical activity, to improve overall
        cardiometabolic health,” says O’Hearn.
