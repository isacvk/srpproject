      <h3 class="content-heading">COVID-19 (coronavirus): Long-term effects</h3>
      <p class="content-desc">
        COVID-19 symptoms can sometimes persist for months. The virus can damage
        the lungs, heart and brain, which increases the risk of long-term health
        problems.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Most people who have coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover
        completely within a few weeks. But some people — even those who had mild
        versions of the disease — continue to experience symptoms after their
        initial recovery.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        These people sometimes describe themselves as "long haulers" and the
        conditions have been called post-COVID-19 syndrome or "long COVID-19."
        These health issues are sometimes called post-COVID-19 conditions.
        They're generally considered to be effects of COVID-19 that persist for
        more than four weeks after you've been diagnosed with the COVID-19
        virus.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Older people and people with many serious medical conditions are the
        most likely to experience lingering COVID-19 symptoms, but even young,
        otherwise healthy people can feel unwell for weeks to months after
        infection. Common signs and symptoms that linger over time include:
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Fatigue<br />
        Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing<br />
        Cough<br />
        Joint pain<br />
        Chest pain<br />
        Memory, concentration or sleep problems<br />
        Muscle pain or headache<br />
        Fast or pounding heartbeat<br />
        Loss of smell or taste<br />
        Depression or anxiety<br />
        Fever<br />
        Dizziness when you stand<br />
        Worsened symptoms after physical or mental activities<br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="content-heading">Organ damage caused by COVID-19</h3>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Although COVID-19 is seen as a disease that primarily affects the lungs,
        it can damage many other organs as well. This organ damage may increase
        the risk of long-term health problems. Organs that may be affected by
        COVID-19 include:
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Heart. Imaging tests taken months after recovery from COVID-19 have
        shown lasting damage to the heart muscle, even in people who experienced
        only mild COVID-19 symptoms. This may increase the risk of heart failure
        or other heart complications in the future.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Lungs. The type of pneumonia often associated with COVID-19 can cause
        long-standing damage to the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The
        resulting scar tissue can lead to long-term breathing problems.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Brain. Even in young people, COVID-19 can cause strokes, seizures and
        Guillain-Barre syndrome — a condition that causes temporary paralysis.
        COVID-19 may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease
        and Alzheimer's disease. Some adults and children experience multisystem
        inflammatory syndrome after they have had COVID-19. In this condition,
        some organs and tissues become severely inflamed.
