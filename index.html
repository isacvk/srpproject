      <p class="content-desc">
        Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the
        SARS-CoV-2 virus.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate
        respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.
        However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.
        Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like
        cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer
        are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with
        COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.
      </p>

      <p class="content-desc">
        The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well
        informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself
        and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others,
        wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an
        alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and
        follow local guidance.
      </p>
      <p class="content-desc">
        The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small
        liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These
        particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It
        is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing
        into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover
        if you feel unwell.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content-heading">What is the origin of COVID-19?</h3>
      <p class="content-desc">
        Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel
        severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated
        from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute
        respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel
        SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
      </p>
      <h3 class="content-heading">When was COVID-19 first discovered?</h3>
      <p class="content-desc">
        The outbreak of Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was initially
        noticed in a seafood market in Wuhan city in Hubei Province of China in
        mid- December, 2019, has now spread to 215 countries/territories/areas
        worldwide.
